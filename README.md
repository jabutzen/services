This is a basic service tracking program that a auto shop might use. It sequentially stores customer names, vehicle information, a recommended next service date, and estimated miles at next service.

This is the main menu when first starting the program. There are five total choices the user can choose from.

Menu option 1 generates the customer list and saves it in a sequential text file. I wrote the code fairly strict, and the details entered must be inputted as per the format in each command line. The "Current vehicle mileage" command line automatically adds 3000 to the number entered, and will store it as the estimated miles for next service.

Menu option 2 displays the text file in its entirety.

Menu option 3 gives the user the ability to search the text file and display on screen the lines associated with the month searched.
